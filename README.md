### I am not the original creator of this client.
All credit goes to the original developers and to the creators of the APIs it leverages.<br>
I am merely making my own changes due to the fact that Meteor no longer supports 1.19 natively.<br>
There will be no downloadable versions of the mod ready-to-use.<br>
If you want to use my version, follow the instructions above regarding compilation.<br> 
Support for this version will not be offered, and the original developers/community likely won't either because it's not their version of the client.<br>
*Functionality is not guaranteed!* Though it should work because I want to use it myself.<br>
**TL;DR: *do not* ask for help in their support Discord, or my own.**<br>
See the original Meteor Client README at the original repository, [here](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client).
